WELCOME TO ZERO!

RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS:
Zero accepts two players. Each player will receive seven cards. When it is your turn, your hand 
will appear on the screen, each card corresponding to a key number. The goal is to play a card
with the same suit and/or rank as the card at the top of the game pile. To play a certain card, 
enter the key number. If the card is invalid, you will receive an error message prompting you 
to play a different card or draw from the deck. To draw, enter -2. When you have no cards 
remaining, type 0. The first player to do so wins. If the deck runs out at any point during 
gameplay, you must restart the game. If a player types zero without an empty hand, the game will
be ended and neither player will win. 

GOOD LUCK!
